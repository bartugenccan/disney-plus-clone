  Disney Clone Built Using React.JS & Firebase

  This is a Disney+ clone website built using <strong><em>React.JS</em></strong> as a Front-end & <strong><em>Firebase</em></strong> as Back-end. It's not a replica, and it     doesn't have all the features of Disney+ website. It's a similar version of Disney with some of the features.This project is showing my abilities in React.JS to build something advanced like Disney+. It contains the home page, login page, movie detail page.
